# TV-Watchlist

The following project takes in data, in this case TV shows, that the user queries via the following API: https://www.tvmaze.com/api
The user can select which shows they would like to add to their watchlist.
The watchlist will populate upon submission of selected TV shows.
The watchlist can have tv shows removed if user chooses to do so.
The watchlist is stored in LocalStorage which stays updated with updates/deletions of items in watchlist and the watchlist will remain upon page reload. 
A small amount of flexbox has been used for responsiveness.
